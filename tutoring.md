## Asking Questions

The tutors' job is to help students in the course learn the material.  Please do take advantage of the tutoring when you need help, but always be aware that it is your responsibility to have done all relevant readings, labs, and CloudCoder exercises before you ask the tutors for assistance.  Be sure to read the [How to ask for help](HowToAskForHelp.html) document.

# In-Class Tutoring

We will have in-class tutors this year for assistance with the labs and assignments.  Those tutors will be available for the last 30 minutes of each class.

# Evening Sessions - To be scheduled

<!--
Monday-Thursday, 6:00pm to 8:30pm in KEC123 

Drop-in tutoring sessions will be held Monday through Thursday from
6:00pm to 8:30pm in KEC123.  These sessions are a great way to get help with labs,
assignments, or anything else you have questions about.

**Important**: Be aware that the evening sessions can be very busy
close to an assignment deadline.  Your best bet is to *start assignments early*
and *ask questions early* to avoid the rush.

Please see [How to ask for help](HowToAskForHelp.html) for some advice on how to ask good questions (ones that lead to learning.)
